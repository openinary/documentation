Openinary is organized as a monorepo with the following structure:

```
openinary/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/          # Media processing API
│   └── web/          # Next.js Frontend
├── packages/
│   └── shared/       # Shared types and utilities
├── docker/           # Optimized Dockerfiles
└── docker-compose.yml
```

- **web/**: Next.js frontend application for managing media

## Packages
