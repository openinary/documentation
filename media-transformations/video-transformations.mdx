## Performance Considerations

Video transformations are significantly more resource-intensive than image operations. Keep these factors in mind:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Processing time" icon="clock">
  Video processing can take 5-30 seconds depending on original file resolution and quality settings.
</Card>

<Card title="Cache efficiency" icon="database">
  Cached video transformations are served in under 50ms, making caching essential for performance.
</Card>

<Card title="Storage impact" icon="hard-drive">
  Higher quality settings result in larger file sizes. Balance quality against storage costs.
</Card>

<Card title="Bandwidth usage" icon="network-wired">
  Consider delivering lower resolutions to mobile devices to reduce bandwidth consumption.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Avoid on-demand video transformations for high-traffic scenarios. Pre-process videos during upload or content ingestion whenever possible.
