## New features

### Docker Resource Limits

The `docker-compose.yml` now includes configurable resource constraints to prevent video processing from overwhelming the server:

```yaml docker-compose.yml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '${DOCKER_CPU_LIMIT:-2.0}'
      memory: ${DOCKER_MEMORY_LIMIT:-4G}
    reservations:
      cpus: '${DOCKER_CPU_RESERVATION:-0.5}'
      memory: ${DOCKER_MEMORY_RESERVATION:-1G}
```

**Default configuration:**
- **Memory limit**: 4GB (suitable for most deployments)
- **CPU limit**: 2.0 cores
- **Memory reservation**: 1GB minimum

<Tip>
For larger servers (16GB+ RAM), you can customize via environment variables:

```bash
DOCKER_MEMORY_LIMIT=12G
DOCKER_CPU_LIMIT=4.0
```
</Tip>

### Job Queue System with Auto-Scaling

Introduced a robust job queue system that prevents concurrent video transformations from consuming all available resources.

**Automatic Concurrency Detection:**
- Formula: **1 worker per 2GB of RAM** (minimum 1, maximum 16)
- Automatically detects the server's total RAM and calculates optimal concurrent jobs
- Example: 8GB RAM = 4 concurrent video jobs maximum

**Manual Override (optional):**

```bash .env
VIDEO_MAX_CONCURRENT=2  # Force specific concurrency level
```

**Additional queue configuration:**

```bash .env
VIDEO_JOB_RETRY_MAX=3              # Retry failed jobs up to 3 times
VIDEO_JOB_CLEANUP_HOURS=24         # Auto-cleanup completed jobs after 24h
VIDEO_WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=1000 # Worker polling frequency
```

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="Upload">
When you upload a video, it's queued for processing instead of being processed immediately.
</Step>

<Step title="Priority">
Thumbnail extraction has higher priority than transformations.
</Step>

<Step title="Concurrency Control">
Only processes N videos simultaneously based on available RAM.
</Step>

<Step title="Retry Logic">
Failed jobs are automatically retried up to 3 times.
</Step>

<Step title="Resource Protection">
Docker limits prevent any single process from consuming too much memory.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Improvements

- **SIGKILL errors**: By limiting concurrent jobs and Docker resources, FFmpeg won't be killed by the OOM killer
- **Large files**: The queue ensures large videos are processed sequentially if resources are limited
- **Server stability**: Self-hosted deployment will remain stable under heavy load
- **Automatic recovery**: Crashed jobs are automatically retried

<Check>
The system works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults. The log on startup will show:

```
[Video Config] RAM: 8.00GB | Max concurrent jobs: 4 (auto-detected)
```
</Check>

<Update label="December 4, 2025">
## New features

- **Video trimming and thumbnail extraction**: Added support for video trimming with `so` (start offset) and `eo` (end offset) parameters
- **Thumbnail generation**: Extract single frames from videos as images using `so` combined with image formats (`webp`, `jpeg`, `png`)
- **API-only mode**: Standalone API deployment option with auto-generated API keys for headless setups
- **Contextual options**: Enhanced documentation with copy, ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor integration options

## Documentation improvements

- Enhanced media transformation documentation with comprehensive parameter reference for images and videos
- Added detailed Docker volume persistence warnings and best practices
- Created comprehensive security guide covering authentication, API keys, and best practices
- Improved Quick Start guide with multiple deployment modes (Normal, S3 Compatible, API Only)
- Updated storage configuration documentation with detailed setup instructions
- Restructured navigation for improved content discoverability

## Bug fixes

- Fixed Docker command consistency across documentation
- Updated navigation links to reflect new documentation structure
</Update>

<Update label="December 2, 2025">
## Breaking changes

- **Parameter syntax update**: Changed transformation parameter syntax from `param:value` to `param_value` to match Cloudinary's syntax 1:1. This change enables faster transition for developers migrating from Cloudinary and reduces the learning curve.

  **Migration example:**
  - Old syntax: `/t/resize:1280x720/image.jpg`
  - New syntax: `/t/w_1280,h_720/image.jpg`

<Tip>
The new syntax matches Cloudinary exactly, making it easier to migrate existing code and learn Openinary if you're already familiar with Cloudinary.
</Tip>
