# Welcome!

**We're Cloudinary, but open source. Powered by Cloudflare.**

Openinary is an open source, Cloudflare-native media CDN that lets you upload, transform, and deliver images and videos from the edge. Built for developers, no-code builders, and indie creators who want fast, modern, self-hostable media infrastructure.

<Info>
  Openinary is currently under active development. This documentation evolves
  with the project.

## Why Openinary?

## Project Architecture

Openinary is organized as a monorepo with multiple applications:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API (Cloudflare Workers)">
    The main API that handles uploads, transformations, and media delivery.

    ```typescript
    // API structure
    apps/api/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── index.ts      // Worker entry point
    │   └── types.d.ts    // TypeScript definitions
    ├── wrangler.toml     // Cloudflare configuration
    └── package.json
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Web (Dashboard)">
    Admin interface to manage your media.

    ```typescript
    // Web dashboard
    apps/web/
    ├── app/             // User interface
    ├── lib/             // Hooks and providers
    └── [folderKey]/     // Folder management
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
