> The promise is simple: store your media in an environment you trust. We are an open-source and self-hostable alternative to Cloudinary.

In an era where developers are increasingly locked into proprietary platforms, we believe in giving you back control. The dominance of closed-source services creates vendor lock-in, unpredictable pricing, and limited transparency; leaving developers at the mercy of corporate decisions. Open source is the solution: it ensures transparency, prevents vendor lock-in, gives you the freedom to customize and extend the platform to your needs, and keeps your data truly yours. By choosing open source, you're investing in a future where technology serves developers, not the other way around.

This freedom doesn't mean compromising on features. Transform your media on-the-fly with a simple and powerful API. Resizing, optimized formats, smart caching, and cloud storage (AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2).
