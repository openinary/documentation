<Info>
**Store your media in an environment you trust.** Openinary is an open-source and self-hostable alternative to Cloudinary, giving you complete control over your media assets.
</Info>

## Why Openinary?

In an era where developers are increasingly locked into proprietary platforms, Openinary gives you back control. The dominance of closed-source services creates vendor lock-in, unpredictable pricing, and limited transparency—leaving developers at the mercy of corporate decisions.

**Open source is the solution:**

- **Transparency**: Full visibility into how your media is processed and stored
- **No vendor lock-in**: Your infrastructure, your rules, your timeline
- **Complete customization**: Extend and modify the platform to fit your exact needs
- **Data ownership**: Your media assets stay truly yours

<Tip>
By choosing open source, you're investing in a future where technology serves developers, not the other way around.
</Tip>

## Key features

This freedom doesn't mean compromising on capabilities. Openinary delivers enterprise-grade media processing with a simple, powerful API:

- **On-the-fly transformations**: Resize, crop, and optimize images and videos dynamically
- **Intelligent format optimization**: Automatic WebP, AVIF, and modern video codec conversion
- **Smart caching**: Built-in caching layer for lightning-fast delivery
- **Cloud storage integration**: Seamless support for AWS S3 and Cloudflare R2
