description: "Step-by-step guide to deploy Openinary on Dokploy"
---

## Prerequisites

- A Dokploy account with access to a server
- Docker support enabled on your Dokploy instance

## Deployment Steps

<Steps>

<Step title="Create or access your project">

If you don't have a project yet, create a new one in Dokploy. Navigate to your project dashboard once created.

</Step>

<Step title="Create a new service from template">

In your project, create a new service:
1. Choose **Template** as the service type
2. Search for **Openinary** in the search bar
3. Click **Create** then **Confirm**

A new service named "Openinary" will appear in your project.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure environment variables">

The environment variables are already pre-configured with placeholders. You'll see variables like:

```bash
IMAGE_TAG=latest
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-sha256-hash-or-long-secret
BETTER_AUTH_URL=your-base-url
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=your-base-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=/api
```

Make sure the `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` are your base URL (the domain where Openinary will be accessible).

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Local Storage">

The template is pre-configured for local storage. No additional environment variables are needed.

</Tab>

<Tab title="S3-Compatible Storage">

If you want to use cloud storage, add your S3-compatible bucket configuration:

```bash
STORAGE_REGION=your-region
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
STORAGE_ENDPOINT=https://your-s3-endpoint.com
STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-cdn-domain.com
```

See the [Storage configuration](/configuration) page for detailed setup instructions.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step title="Configure your domain (recommended)">

<Note>
Before deploying for the first time, it's highly recommended to configure your custom domain if desired.
</Note>

Navigate to the **Domains** tab and set up your domain configuration. While not mandatory, **we strongly recommend using HTTPS** for production deployments.

</Step>

<Step title="Deploy your application">

Once your environment variables and domain are configured:
1. Navigate to the **Environment** tab to verify everything is correct
2. Click the **Deploy** button
3. Click **Confirm** to start the deployment

<Tip>
We recommend watching the logs during the first deployment to ensure everything runs smoothly.
</Tip>

The first deployment will begin. If everything goes well, you should see this message at the end:

```
Docker Compose Deployed: ✅
```

<Check>
Your Openinary instance is now deployed!
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Access your instance">

Navigate to the **Domains** tab and visit the generated URL or your configured custom domain.

</Step>

<Step title="Initial setup">

You should land on the initial setup page where you can create your administrator account.

<Warning>
**Important**: Create your admin account immediately after deployment, as the setup route is publicly accessible until completed.
</Warning>

After signing in, you should see the sample assets or your bucket content in the Dashboard.

<Check>
Openinary is now fully configured and ready to use!
</Check>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. Check the deployment logs in Dokploy for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure your domain DNS is properly configured (if using a custom domain)

If problems persist, please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/openinary/openinary/issues) with your deployment logs.

## Next Steps
