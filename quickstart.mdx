## Prerequisites

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Docker setup">

    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.x or higher)
    - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 2.x or higher)

## Quick Start

Run Openinary locally with Docker in just a few commands. Openinary supports two deployment modes depending on your needs.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Clone the repository">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openinary/openinary.git
cd openinary
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose your deployment mode">

Select the deployment mode that fits your use case:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Normal (Dashboard + API)">

Ideal for managing your users, API keys, and media through a web interface.

<Steps>

<Step title="Start with Docker">

```bash
docker-compose --profile full up --build
```

</Step>

<Step title="Initial setup via web interface">

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Visit `/setup` to create your admin account
3. Log in
4. Go to `/api-keys` to create an API key
5. Use this key for your image/video transformations

<Check>
Your Openinary instance is operational.
</Check>

</Step>

</Steps>

</Tab>

<Tab title="Standalone API">

Ideal for pure backend usage with your own application.

<Steps>

<Step title="Start with Docker">

```bash
docker-compose --profile api up --build
```

<Warning>
**Important:** The generated API key will appear in the Docker logs: copy and save this key! It will not be displayed again.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Test the API">

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Image transformation
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:3000/t/resize:800x600/image.png"
```

</Step>

</Steps>

</Steps>

## Test with Sample Files

Sample files are available in `/apps/api/public/` for testing:
- `image.png` - Test image transformations
- `video.mp4` - Test video transformations

## Connecting External S3-Compatible Storage

By default, Openinary uses local file storage. For production or to use cloud storage, you can configure environment variables to connect to any S3-compatible storage provider (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, DigitalOcean Spaces, Minio, and more).

See the [Storage configuration](/configuration) page for detailed setup instructions.

## Development Mode (Alternative)

If you prefer to run in development mode without Docker:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

Development URLs will be the same (API: http://localhost:3000, Frontend: http://localhost:3001)

<Warning>
**Production Deployment**: When deploying to production, always use cloud storage (S3 or R2) instead of local file storage. Configure your cloud storage credentials in `apps/api/.env`. The local `public/` folder is only suitable for testing and development.
