## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.x or higher)

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
docker pull openinary/openinary:latest
```

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Normal">

Run the dashboard and API

```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -d -p 3000:3000 -v openinary-cache:/app/apps/api/cache -v openinary-public:/app/apps/api/public -v openinary-db:/app/data openinary/openinary:latest
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="With S3 Compatible Storage">

Run with cloud storage instead of local file storage

```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -d -p 3000:3000 -v openinary-db:/app/data \
  -e STORAGE_REGION=us-east-1 \
  -e STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
  -e STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
  -e STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=openinary-filebase \
  -e STORAGE_ENDPOINT=https://s3.filebase.com/ \
  openinary/openinary:latest
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="API Only">

Run with a standalone API *(auto-generates API key)*

```bash
docker pull openinary/openinary-api:latest

docker run --platform linux/amd64 -d -p 3000:3000 -v openinary-cache:/app/apps/api/cache -v openinary-public:/app/apps/api/public -v openinary-db:/app/data -e MODE=api openinary/openinary-api:latest
```

<Warning>
**Important:** The generated API key will appear in the Docker container logs. Check the logs with `docker logs <container-id>` and copy and save this key! It will not be displayed again.
</Warning>

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Initial Setup

**Normal mode (Dashboard + API):**
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. You'll be redirected to `/setup` to create your admin account
3. Once logged in, in the bottom left of the dashboard, click on your profile and select “API Keys” from the menu to generate your first API key.

<Check>
Your Openinary instance is operational.
</Check>

## Test with Sample Files

Sample files are available in the container at `/app/apps/api/public/` for testing:
- `example-loan.jpg` - Test image transformations
- `example-rahime-gul.mp4` - Test video transformations

## Connecting External S3-Compatible Storage

By default, Openinary uses local file storage. For production or to use cloud storage, you can configure environment variables to connect to any S3-compatible storage provider (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, DigitalOcean Spaces, Minio, and more).

See the [Storage configuration](/configuration) page for detailed setup instructions.

## Development Mode (Alternative)

If you prefer to run in development mode without Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/openinary/openinary.git && cd openinary

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

Development URLs will be the same (API: http://localhost:3000, Frontend: http://localhost:3001)

<Warning>
**Volume Persistence**: When deploying to production, ensure all three Docker volumes are properly persisted across deployments:
- `db-data` - Contains database file (admin account, API keys)
- `public-files` - Contains uploaded files and media
- `cache-data` - Contains cached transformations

If any of these volumes are removed or recreated during deployment, the corresponding data will be lost. For production environments, consider using cloud storage (S3-compatible) for better reliability and scalability.
