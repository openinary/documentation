## Prerequisites

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Docker setup">

    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.x or higher)
    - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 2.x or higher)

  </Tab>

## Quick Start

Run Openinary locally with Docker in just a few commands. The setup runs the API and the Dashboard in a single container:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Clone the repository">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openinary/openinary.git
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Change into the project directory">

```bash
cd openinary
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure environment variables (optional)">

  <Tip>
  For local testing with default settings (using local file storage), you can skip this step.
  </Tip>

  To configure S3-compatible cloud storage (Cloudflare R2 or AWS S3), copy the example environment file:

  ```bash
  cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
  ```

  Then edit `apps/api/.env` with your cloud storage credentials. For full details and options, see the [Storage configuration](/configuration) guide.


  </Step>

  <Step title="Build and start all services">

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

  </Step>

</Steps>

**That's it!** Docker will:
- Build the API and Web applications in a single container
- Install all dependencies automatically
- Start all services (API on port 3002, Web on port 3001, Nginx on port 3000)

## Access Your Applications

Once the container is running, access everything at:

- **Main Application**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Endpoints**: http://localhost:3000/api

## Test with Sample Files

Sample files are available in `/apps/api/public/` for testing:
- `image.png` - Test image transformations
- `video.mp4` - Test video transformations

## Stopping the Application

To stop all services:

```bash
# Stop and remove containers
docker-compose down

# Stop containers and remove volumes (clears cache)
docker-compose down -v
```

## API-Only Mode

If you only need the API without the frontend:

```bash
# Start API only
docker compose --profile api up --build

# Run in background
docker compose --profile api up -d --build
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Development Mode (Alternative)

If you prefer to run in development mode without Docker:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

Development URLs will be the same (API: http://localhost:3000, Frontend: http://localhost:3001)

<Warning>
**Production Deployment**: When deploying to production, always use cloud storage (S3 or R2) instead of local file storage. Configure your cloud storage credentials in `apps/api/.env`. The local `public/` folder is only suitable for testing and development.
